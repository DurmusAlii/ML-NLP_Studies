syllable.py, __init__.py, and vectors folder are for the syllabify method that I use. You can visit the github link with : https://github.com/ftkurt/python-syllable

To be able to run the code you need to unzip the folder and pip install -r requirements.txt also download the imported libraries if there are any missing.

Also I've used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustfkeskin/turkish-wikipedia-dump this dataset in my project. You need to download it and save it in the same location.
